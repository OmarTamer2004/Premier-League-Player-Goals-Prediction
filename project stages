This project was developed step-by-step to predict the number of goals scored by Premier League players using a Linear Regression model.

1️⃣ Problem Definition
Objective: Predict how many goals a player will score based on match statistics.

Context: Useful for analysts, scouts, and fantasy league enthusiasts.

2️⃣ Data Collection
Dataset: EPL 2020–21 Player Stats

Key features: Goals, Assists, Minutes, xG, xA, Pass accuracy, etc.

3️⃣ Data Preprocessing
Cleaned dataset (.dropna())

Removed unnecessary columns (e.g., player names)

Selected numeric features only for model training

Feature engineering: created or adjusted columns like MinsPerMatch

4️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualizations:

Histogram of goals

Scatter plot: Goals vs Assists (colored by position)

Correlation heatmap for numeric features

Identified key contributors to goal scoring (e.g., xG, Mins, Assists)

5️⃣ Model Building
Model: LinearRegression (from Scikit-learn)

Split data: 80% training, 20% testing

Evaluated using:

R² Score: ~0.60

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): ~1.24

6️⃣ Prediction
Created a custom input to test the model:

python
Copy
Edit
model.predict([[Age, Matches, Starts, Mins, Assists, xG, xA, Passes_Attempted, Perc_Passes_Completed, MinsPerMatch]])
Used real-world examples to test accuracy.

7️⃣ Results & Visualization
Visual tools: Seaborn + Matplotlib

Helped understand:

Stats distribution

Key feature importance

Model behavior

8️⃣ Future Improvements
Try advanced models: Ridge, Lasso, or Ensemble methods

Encode categorical variables (e.g., Position, Club)

Add new features (e.g., Shots on Target, Key Passes)
